# Data science tools and ecosystem


```python
# Create a markdown cell for an introduction

# Write an introductory sentence about the notebook such as the follows:
# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized
```

In this notebook, data science tools and ecosystem are summarised


```python
# Create a markdown cell to list data science languages

# Start the cell with an overview line such as:
# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
# Then create an ordered list (i.e. numbered) listing 3 (or more) commonly used languages for data science.
```

some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are
1. PYTHON
2. SQL
3. JAVA


```python
# Create a markdown cell to list data science libraries

# Add an overview line to the cell like:
# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
```

Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
1. PANDAS
2. SEABORN
3. SCIKIT-LEARN
4. KERAS


```python
# create a markdown cell with a table of Data Science tools

# Create a single column table in this cell with the first row containing the header 
# Data Science Tools. The subsequent three rows in the table should indicate three development 
# environment open source tools used in data science.
```

| Data Science Tools |
|--------------------|
| MYSQL     |
| SPYDER   |
|KUBEFLOW|
|KIBANA|


```python
# Create a markdown cell introducing arithmetic expression examples

# Add a line in this cell with H3 style heading with text like:

# Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.
```

### Below are a few example of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python.


```python
# Create a code cell to multiply and add numbers

# In this code cell evaluate the expression (3*4)+5.
# Insert a comment line before the expression to explain the operation e.g.  This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers.
# Then execute the cell to ensure the expression returns the expected output of 17.
```


```python
# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers
(3*4)+5
```




    17




```python
# Create a code cell to convert minutes to hours

# In this code cell write an expression that converts 200 minutes into hours.
# Insert a comment line before the expression to explain the operation 
# e.g.  This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60.
```


```python
# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60.
200/60
```

```python
# insert a markdown cell to list Objectives

# Below the introduction cell created in Exercise 3, 
# insert a new markdown cell to list the objectives that this notebook covered(i.e. some of the key takeaways from the course). 
# In this new cell start with an introductory line titled: Objectives: in bold font. 
# Then using an unordered list (bullets) indicate 3 to 5 items covered in this notebook, 
# such as List popular languages for Data Science.
```

**OBJECTIVES**
- LIST POPULAR LANGUAGES FOR DATA SCIENCE
- LIST MOST COMMON TOOLS USED BY DATA SCIENTISTS
- LIST COMMONLY USED LIBRARIES BY DATA SCIENTIST


```python
# Create a markdown cell to indicate the Author's name

# In this markdown cell markdown cell include the following text Author in H2 style heading.
# Include your name as regular text below the word Author.
```

## Author
